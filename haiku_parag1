<h1>Haiku Introduction</h1>
<p>
Haiku (俳句) is a type of short form poetry originally from Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consists of 
three phrases that contain a <i>kireji</i>, or "cutting word", 17 on (phonetic units similar to syllables) in 
a 5, 7, 5 pattern, and a <i>kigo</i>, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are 
generally classified as senryū.

Haiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese poem called renga. These haiku written as an 
opening stanza were known as <i>hokku</i> and over time writers began to write them as stand-alone poems. 
Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.
