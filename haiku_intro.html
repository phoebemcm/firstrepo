<h1><>Discussion of Haiku</h1>

<p>Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases that contain 
a <i>kireji</i>, or "cutting word", 17 on (phonetic units similar to 
syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern, and a <i>>kigo</i>, or seasonal reference. 
Similar i>poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified 
as <i>senryÅ«>/i>.</p>
