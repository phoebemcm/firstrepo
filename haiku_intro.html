Discussion of Haiku
Haiku (俳句) is a type of short form poetry originally from Japan. 
Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases that contain 
a kireji, or "cutting word", 17 on (phonetic units similar to 
syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern, and a kigo, or seasonal reference. 
Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified 
as senryū --Wikipedia
